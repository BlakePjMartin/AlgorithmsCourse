Algorithms Course, Part 1 - Coursera - Princeton
============

This repository contains my assignment code for the Algorithms Part 1 course offered by Princeton through Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).

Motivation
----------------------------
I enrolled in this course to:
* Continue developing my Java programming skills
* Review and learn algorithms that could be used in future projects
* Receive feedback on assignments that were graded based on correctness, memory, and timing

**Final Course Grade:**   




About the Course
----------------------------
Taken from the course page on Coursera:

*This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of **Java implementations**. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.*

Assignment 2 - Deques and Randomized Queues
----------------------------

<details>
	<summary>Grade: 100/100</summary>
	
**Goal (taken from assigment specification):**   
Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

**Files Submitted:**
* [Deque.java](queues/src/Deque.java)
* [RandomizedQueue.java](queues/src/RandomizedQueue.java)
* [Permutation.java](queues/src/Permutation.java)

Assignment 3 - Collinear Points
----------------------------

<details>
	<summary>Grade: 92/100</summary>
	
**Goal (taken from assigment specification):**   
Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.

**Files Submitted:**
* [Point.java](collinear/src/Point.java)
* [BruteCollinearPoints.java](collinear/src/BruteCollinearPoints.java)
* [FastCollinearPoints.java](collinear/src/FastCollinearPoints.java)

Assignment 4 - 8 Puzzle
----------------------------

<details>
	<summary>Grade: 100/100</summary>
	
**Goal (taken from assigment specification):**   
Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

**Files Submitted:**
* [Board.java](8puzzle/src/Board.java)
* [Solver.java](8puzzle/src/Solver.java)

Assignment 5 - KD-Trees
----------------------------

<details>
	<summary>Grade: 100/100</summary>
	
**Goal (taken from assigment specification):**   
Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have *x*- and *y*-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a *2d-tree* to support efficient *range search* (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and *nearest-neighbor search* (find a closest point to a query point).

**Files Submitted:**
* [PointSET.java](kdtree/src/PointSET.java)
* [KdTree.java](kdtree/src/KdTree.java)

**Assignment Specification:**
